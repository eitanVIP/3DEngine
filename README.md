# 3D Engine in Python

Welcome to the **3D Engine** project! This is a custom-built 3D rendering engine developed entirely from scratch in Python. The engine handles rendering 3D scenes, implementing essential graphics concepts like transformations, lighting, and projection.

## Features

- **3D Rendering**: Visualize 3D objects in real time.
- **Lighting and Shading**: Supports basic lighting models like ambient, diffuse, and specular lighting.
- **Interactive Camera**: Move around the scene to explore different views.
- **From Scratch**: Built without relying on external game engines, focusing on low-level concepts.
