# 3D Engine in Python

Welcome to the **3D Engine** project! This is a custom-built 3D rendering engine developed entirely from scratch in Python. The engine handles rendering 3D scenes, implementing essential graphics concepts like transformations, lighting, and projection.

## Features

- **3D Rendering**: Visualize 3D objects in real time.
- **Custom Pipeline**: Implements a custom rendering pipeline including:
  - Vertex transformation
  - Perspective projection
  - Clipping and rasterization
- **Lighting and Shading**: Supports basic lighting models like ambient, diffuse, and specular lighting.
- **Interactive Camera**: Move around the scene to explore different views.
- **From Scratch**: Built without relying on external game engines, focusing on low-level concepts.

## Demo

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. This project uses the following libraries:
- `numpy` (for vector and matrix operations)
- `pygame` or `tkinter` (for windowing and rendering)

Install dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pygame
```

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/3d-engine.git
cd 3d-engine
```

Run the project:

```bash
python main.py
```

### Controls

- **W/A/S/D**: Move the camera
- **Arrow Keys**: Rotate the view
- **+/-**: Zoom in/out

## Project Structure

- **`engine/`**
  - `camera.py`: Implements the camera and perspective projection.
  - `mesh.py`: Handles 3D objects and their transformations.
  - `renderer.py`: Core rendering pipeline.
- **`assets/`**
  - Contains sample 3D models and textures.
- **`main.py`**
  - Entry point for running the engine.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Add support for texture mapping.
- [ ] Implement advanced shading (Phong, Gouraud, etc.).
- [ ] Add a basic physics engine.
- [ ] Optimize rendering for better performance.
